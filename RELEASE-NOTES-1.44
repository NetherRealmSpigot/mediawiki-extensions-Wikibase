== Upgrading notes for 1.44 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.44 upgrades are below:

* (T291617) Wikis that do not have either of the following (equivalent) lines in their config:
  require_once "$IP/extensions/Wikibase/repo/config/Wikibase.example.php";
  require_once "$IP/extensions/Wikibase/repo/ExampleSettings.php";
  probably need to change their config, see defaultEntityNamespaces below.
* Entries in the `wbt_term_in_lang` table will be sanitized so that the `wbtl_type_id` column
  always contains `1` as the value for labels, `2` for descriptions and `3` for aliases. This
  migration may take a while when running `update.php`.
* The wbt_type database table was dropped.
* (T384344) The RDF output has changed slightly:
  three prefixes have changed, by default from s:/ref:/v: to wds:/wdref:/wdv:,
  and hashes of somevalue (unknown value) snak blank nodes have also changed.
  If you use the WDQS Streaming Updater, you should do a full data reload.
  (If you donâ€™t know what that means, you can safely ignore it.)

* (T291617) The defaultEntityNamespaces repo setting now defaults to true.
  It was previously set to true in the example settings,
  so for wikis that use the example settings, nothing changes.
  Wikis that do not use the example settings probably want to set
  $wgWBRepoSettings['defaultEntityNamespaces'] = false;
  in their LocalSettings.
