== Upgrading notes for 1.41 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.41 upgrades are below:

* (T333662) The `entity-schema` property data type,
  which was unintentionally enabled by default for several Wikibase releases
  despite being disabled as incomplete on Wikidata,
  has been removed from Wikibase.
  We expect that no other installations were using it;
  however, if you need this data type to exist
  (e.g. if you created any properties with this data type),
  you can install the EntitySchema extension,
  which now contains an `entity-schema` data type that is fully compatible
  with the one previously included in Wikibase.
